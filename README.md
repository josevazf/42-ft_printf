# 42 Common Core / ft_printf
This project is about a partial recoding of the standard printf() function while learning about variadic functions in C.
###
Handles only the following conversions:
- `%c` - print a single character
- `%s` - print a string of characters
- `%p` - the void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal
- `%d` - print a decimal (base 10) number
- `%i` - print an integer in base 10
- `%u` - print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number
- `%x` - print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with lowercase
- `%X` - print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with uppercase
- `%%` - print a percent sign

*Aditional flags to be implemented later on.
